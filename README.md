<h2>Pre-Project Briefing</h2>
This is the first HTML project prompted by The Odin Project. 
In it, I will put my beginning HTML skills to the test by designing a basic recipe web page. In it, I'll construct the basic boilerplate of a web page; add heading tags; <p>, <strong>, <em>, etc. as well as links, lists, and images.
